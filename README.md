# GigWrangler - Connecting Musicians and Venues -  App  

Musician Booking app built in React/Redux/JS, Google Maps API and tested with Enzyme. I created my own adatbase of 3000+ venues throught the US, and used google maps API to connect them. I include venue data on each venue that allows musicians to connect with the venues and create a tour throughout the country.
